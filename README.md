# 🧾 Employee Management System (EMS)

## 📌 Project Objective

The **Employee Management System** is a full-stack **MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js)** web application that streamlines employee lifecycle management — from onboarding to salary and attendance tracking.

Admins and HRs can **add, edit, delete, and view employees**, manage departments, assign salaries, mark attendance, and generate reports — all within a secure, responsive interface.
